Fears for US woman's life as abortion denied in Malta - BBC News,"By Sara Monetta BBC News For the past week, the couple have been stuck in a hospital room, waiting. His voice is tired and angry. He worries Andrea's condition could change rapidly at any time. In 2017, another tourist had to be evacuated to France to have an emergency termination. But for Maltese women this is not option. It's a law that Dr Lara Dimitrijevic, a lawyer in Malta and chair of the Women's Rights Foundation, has been fighting for years. Ms Dimitrijevic says the law needs to change because a practice like this is not just a health risk for women, it's also a psychological trauma for them and their families. The BBC has approached both the Maltese government and the hospital's administration for comment.

Capitol riot hearing: Vote workers detail death threats - BBC News,"This video can not be played Election officials faced relentless pressure from former President Donald Trump and his supporters to overturn his defeat in the 2020 poll, a congressional panel has heard. Elected Republicans as well as poll workers say they were threatened. A Georgia vote counter said she was forced to temporarily leave her home, while an Arizona official said protesters called him a paedophile. The House of Representatives panel accuses Mr Trump of an attempted coup. Mr Trump has stood by his disproven claim he only lost the 2020 presidential vote because of fraud, and has dismissed the panel as a political witch hunt. On Tuesday, in the fourth public hearing so far, the panel heard from election workers in the states of Arizona and Georgia. Mr Biden defeated Mr Trump in both states, which had previously backed Republicans for the White House. The panel also heard testimony from Shaye Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, who became the targets of conspiracy theories in their jobs as election workers in Fulton County, Georgia. Although Mr Biden won the state by nearly 12,000 votes, Mr Trump and his supporters spread unfounded claims of mass voter fraud. Ms Moss said she was forced to move home for two months, has gained about 60lb (27kg) in weight and is now reluctant to leave the house at all. He said that Trump's legal team alleged more than 10,000 dead people voted, but a review found a total of only four. The hearings have attempted to tie the former president directly to the efforts to overturn the election.

How Russia has outflanked Ukraine in Africa - BBC News,"By Paul Melly Africa Programme, Chatham House, London Addresses to summits and national parliaments around the world by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have become a staple of the diplomatic calendar over the last few months. But when he spoke to the African Union (AU) on Monday only four heads of state from the continent listened in, with the others represented by subordinates or officials. So, in trying to shift African perspectives on Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, Mr Zelensky cannot deploy political or security clout comparable with Moscow's. Ukraine is not a global military power and it is not a permanent member of the UN Security Council, unlike Russia. As a result, many African leaders have concluded that they simply cannot afford to emulate direct Western confrontation with Moscow. Early this month Senegal's President Macky Sall, the current head of the AU, flew to the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi to discuss with Mr Putin how to free up the obstacles that are curbing desperately needed food exports from both Russia and Ukraine. And last week South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa called Mr Putin to discuss deliveries of Russian agricultural products and fertiliser to Africa. The talks produced some modest progress though not a decisive breakthrough. Meanwhile, there are some hints that the invasion of Ukraine may be putting strains on Russian military engagement in Africa, with unconfirmed rumours of some troops from the mercenary group Wagner being called back from Central African Republic (CAR). That would hardly be a surprise, given the demands of the intense military campaign in the crucial Donbas region. Moreover, official Russian security and military deals in Africa are actually being reinforced. Cameroon has become the latest target of this charm offensive. This embraces intelligence, training and sharing expertise in tackling terrorism and maritime piracy. Joint exercises are planned. The document makes no mention of arms shipments but hints suggestively that additional forms of collaboration could yet be agreed. Although this new agreement is less specific, it appears to be stirring concern in Western capitals. However, some African governments are reluctant to buy into this negative perception of the Putin regime. And that applies not only to those such as Mali and CAR. Senegal, for example, opted not to support the 2 March UN General Assembly motion calling on Russia to stop using force against Ukraine. And then on 7 April the country also abstained when the General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. Domestic public opinion plays a part in such stances. Lining up with France, the US and the UK is not always the most popular stance on the continent and the Cameroonian government, like a number of its peers, appears to have concluded that it had to take account of such popular feelings. However, Cameroon is going much further, taking the proactive decision to sign the new military cooperation agreement with Russia even as Russian forces continued to bombard Ukrainian cities. This distinctive stance is probably explained by the domestic situation in Cameroon. Yet Western partners are concerned about human rights and governance issues and their assistance has come with conditions. With the Americans holding back, some Cameroonian analysts fear that the government may now have decided to seek alternative support from a partner with fewer scruples about uncompromising military tactics, at the cost of human rights accountability. Moscow's track record elsewhere in Africa suggests that it is comfortable in backing a hardline approach. In CAR, Wagner has been training the army since 2018 and its men helped government forces repulse a rebel assault on the capital Bangui in early 2021. Wagner also operates alongside the national army in central Mali where, Human Rights Watch and local people have alleged, these two allied forces have tortured and killed villagers. Malian government forces and the Russian mercenaries are alleged to have killed more than 300 people in Moura  in March.

Monkeypox: First Singapore case recorded in British flight attendant - BBC News,"By Frances Mao BBC News Singapore has recorded its first recent case of monkeypox in a British flight attendant who entered the country last week. More than 2,100 cases have been detected in 42 countries since May. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , but the disease has also spread to North America, South America and Australia. The WHO has recorded one death in this outbreak. The disease typically occurs in remote parts of central and west African countries, but there have been unusually high numbers of people infected with monkeypox outside of Africa this year with no travel links to the region. Watch What Is Monkeypox? on BBC iPlayer. In Singapore, health officials said the man was in a stable condition after testing positive for the disease on Monday and had been taken into an isolation ward. Thirteen of his close contacts have also been put in quarantine. They were his crew and airline colleagues, some media outlets reported. South Korean authorities on Tuesday also confirmed their first suspected cases of the disease. Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe. Symptoms of monkeypox include a rash which starts on the face and spreads to the body. The WHO says the risk to the general public remains low as transmission between humans requires close or direct physical contact with infectious lesions or ulcers.

French elections: What now for opposition left and far-right? - BBC News,"By Paul Kirby In Paris They were the big winners of France's elections, tearing apart President Emmanuel Macron's majority. They are poles apart but have largely the same ambition of opposing the centrist Macron government. The surprise of the elections was the success of Marine Le Pen's far right National Rally, which increased its presence in the Assembly tenfold. A look at the dark blue areas on the map shows how far they have spread from their strongholds in the deep south and Pas de Calais in the north. Their success in 89 seats came even though Ms Le Pen was barely visible on the campaign trail in the two weeks before the vote. Both parties aim to resist the president's programme of reforms, although National Rally has said it may back measures to alleviate the cost of living crisis if their own proposals are adopted. Where the two parties are united is in opposition to the president's bid to raise gradually the retirement age from 62 to 65. The far right wants to keep it as it is, and Nupes wants to bring the pension age down to 60.

Thailand cannabis: From a war on drugs to weed curries - BBC News,"Other countries in the region have followed the same punitive approach, notably the Philippines after President Rodrigo Duterte took office in 2016. Singapore and Malaysia have imposed the death penalty for drug trafficking for decades. Tourists coming to South East Asia have long been warned of the harsh penalties they face if caught with even small amounts of marijuana. It's hard to imagine, then, that what we have seen over the past weeks is actually happening in Thailand. architect of the new law, which now gives Thailand perhaps the most liberal marijuana regime anywhere in the world The new law appears to give Thailand what is perhaps the most liberal approach to marijuana anywhere in the world. For the moment, people can grow and consume as much of the plant as they like, though there are a few limits on how they can market and sell it. Two grandparents, his father and then his mother died from cancer. On rushing back from the US to care for his mother, he tried, and failed, to persuade her to use cannabis products to ease her pain, and found it difficult to get access to what were then illegal substances. What explains this dramatic turnaround in a country still led by conservative military men who seem unlikely drug law liberalisers? So, he was able to tell the cheering crowds, as he announced the new law in his political home base of Buriram earlier this month, that he had delivered what he had promised. He believes in the medical benefits of legalisation, which he hopes will allow poorer Thais to grow their own treatments, rather than having to pay for expensive chemical drugs. He has opened the first clinic in Bangkok that focuses solely on these kinds of treatments. Already some of Thailand's biggest corporations are looking at ways in which they can cash in on the weed bonanza. By liberalising the law so quickly and so completely, the government hopes to steal a march on neighbouring countries, many of which may in any case be reluctant to follow the trail blazed by Thailand. It was a military minister of justice, General Paiboon Kumchaya, who announced in 2016 that the war on drugs had failed, and another, less punitive method of dealing with the use and abuse of narcotics was needed. However, the government may not have been prepared for the enthusiastic embrace of cannabis in all its forms seen across Thailand since the new law was passed. The government is now drafting additional regulations over its use. Officially its position is that the law only allows cannabis use for medical, not recreational purposes, but it's hard to see how they will enforce that distinction. She is experimenting with different strains of the plant to help local farmers cultivate the right kinds for the region. Mr Kruesopon says he has no issue with further regulation. He advocates sales of marijuana only from licensed vendors, with a prescription, and never to anyone under 18 years old. This is an uncharacteristically bold step by the Thai government, into a brave new world. The rest of the region will be watching to see if it pays off.

"Ankur Warikoo, Rachana Ranade: The YouTubers Indians turn to for financial advice - BBC News","By Nikhil Inamdar and  Ayushi Shah BBC News He rummaged through books and tutorials, but quickly learnt that it was the young financial content creators on YouTube that spoke his language. It's exactly what India's young investors are after. Millions of them opened trading accounts during the pandemic to participate in the market bull run, aided by investing services online. But only three out of 10 Indians are financially literate, official surveys point out. And they are hungry to learn how to make an easy buck in the stock market, or the ropes of entrepreneurship amid a unicorn boom that's made overnight billionaires. It's this sweet spot that's turned financial content into one of the fastest growing genres online. His massive popularity even got him a publishing contract last year, with his first book, Do Epic Shit, quickly becoming a bestseller. While the perception is that he became a sensation overnight, Mr Warikoo says his journey as a content creator started nearly a decade ago. But the pandemic proved to be an inflection point. That's a gap in the market that many of the YouTubers have successfully been able to fill. Experts laud the fact that financial education is now more accessible, but they also advise caution. While business news channels are strictly regulated, most digital content creators operate in a grey zone. Ms Ranade and Mr Warikoo do not recommend individual stocks, but many others do, often without the necessary expertise or qualifications. So the next few years, Mr Ethiraj says, will be the first test of whether the success of India's new money influencers is enduring or merely ephemeral.

Jason Ravnsborg: South Dakota prosecutor ousted over hit-and-run - BBC News,"South Dakota lawmakers have voted to impeach and remove from office the state's attorney general over a 2020 car crash in which he killed a man. Jason Ravnsborg has said he thought he struck a deer while driving home at night on 12 September 2020 and did not know it was a man until the next day. The Republican had refused to resign over the incident. Despite facing opposition from all corners, Ravnsborg maintained his innocence in the death of Joseph Boever, 55. Last year, he beat the criminal case against him by taking a plea deal on misdemeanour traffic charges. But his luck ran out in the state legislature, where he was impeached by the House in April. On Tuesday, the Senate convicted Ravnsborg for committing crimes that caused someone's death, and on a malfeasance charge for misleading law enforcement and abusing the powers of his office. The move triggers his automatic removal from office. The chamber also voted unanimously to bar the prosecutor from holding future office in the state. Investigators arriving at the scene one day after the crash found a working torch, which was still on and only inches from the road, and bone scrapings on the ground. Ravnsborg is the first official to be impeached in state history.
