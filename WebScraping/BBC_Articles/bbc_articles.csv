"Afghan earthquake: At least 1,000 people killed and 1,500 injured - BBC News","BBC News This video can not be played A powerful earthquake has killed at least 1,000 people and injured 1,500 in eastern Afghanistan, an official of the ruling Taliban told the BBC. Hundreds of houses were destroyed by the magnitude 6.1 event, which occurred at a depth of 51km (32 miles). The earthquake struck about 44km from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Witnesses reported feeling the quake in both Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Earthquakes tend to cause significant damage in Afghanistan, where dwellings in many rural areas are unstable or poorly built. In remote areas, helicopters have been ferrying victims to hospitals. Speaking to the BBC, a doctor in Paktika said medical workers were among the victims. Communication following the quake is difficult because of damage to mobile phone towers and the death toll could rise further still, another local journalist in the area told the BBC. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage in Pakistan, according to BBC Urdu. Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it's located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Most recently, in January killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.

Afghanistan earthquake: 'Every street you go you hear mourning' - BBC News,"By Thom Poole BBC News This is how one Afghan described the situation after a powerful earthquake left hundreds dead. The quake happened in the early hours of the morning, causing houses to collapse and crush people sleeping inside. Rescuers have in some cases been digging with their bare hands, if they have been able to reach the affected areas at all. Rural eastern Afghanistan is not an easy place to travel to. The toll is expected to grow as the picture becomes clearer. Afghans are already facing hardship on several fronts. Poverty is rampant, and the country has endured decades of conflict. When the Taliban took over Afghanistan last year, many countries cut development aid. Already thinly stretched services are unlikely to be able to cope. This video can not be played Aid agencies are trying to help but communications and water provisions are adding to the challenge. They are focussing on bringing food, medicine and emergency shelter to those in need.

President Biden urges petrol tax 'holiday' as fuel prices bite - BBC News,"With national elections for Congress coming in November, Mr Biden is under pressure to respond. Analysts say that removing the levy would have limited impact on household petrol and diesel costs. Political support for the gas tax holiday, which would require an act of Congress, is also uncertain, with members of Mr Biden's own party concerned that the move would primarily benefit oil and gas firms. The White House acknowledged the criticism, but said policymakers should do what is in their power to try to ease the strain on families. Currently, the US imposes a tax of roughly 18 cents per gallon on gasoline and 24 cents on diesel, using the money collected to help pay for highway infrastructure. The move is the latest effort from countries around the world to address the soaring energy costs. Oil prices have surged since last year, as demand outstrips supplies constrained by cuts that many firms made after the pandemic hit in 2020 and prompted demand to crater. Mr Biden has already taken steps like releasing unprecedented amounts of oil from national reserves and lifting taxes on imports of solar panels. As well as suspending the national gasoline tax, Mr Biden is urging similar steps by state governments, which typically impose their own taxes, often higher than the federal government's. Some states, including New York, have already suspended those charges. The president has also called for oil and gas firms to increase their output, intensifying his criticism of the sector in recent weeks. However, there is little political momentum in the US for funding relief for households through something like the UK's recently announced windfall tax on energy company profits.

Shaye Moss: 'I don't want anyone knowing my name' - BBC News,"A former US election worker who was singled out by Trump allies in their baseless fraud claims has testified to lawmakers probing the Capitol riot. On day four of public hearings, the panel heard from Republicans who Mr Trump pressured to overturn the vote. The month after Mr Trump's election loss, the mother and daughter were thrust into the spotlight after a lawyer for the Trump campaign released a CCTV clip showing Ms Moss appearing to be handed something by her mother. Conservative media and Trump aides began arguing that the edited footage showed an illegal scheme to input 18,000 false ballots supporting Mr Biden into election counting machines. As Mr Trump and his allies continued to argue their debunked claims, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked Georgia lawmakers to search the homes of Ms Moss and Ms Freeman for evidence, and compared them to drug dealers. She has successfully sued one conservative media network, settling for an undisclosed sum, and is still actively suing Mr Giuliani.

Fears for US woman's life as abortion denied in Malta - BBC News,"By Sara Monetta BBC News For the past week, the couple have been stuck in a hospital room, waiting. His voice is tired and angry. He worries Andrea's condition could change rapidly at any time. In 2017, another tourist had to be evacuated to France to have an emergency termination. But for Maltese women this is not option. It's a law that Dr Lara Dimitrijevic, a lawyer in Malta and chair of the Women's Rights Foundation, has been fighting for years. Ms Dimitrijevic says the law needs to change because a practice like this is not just a health risk for women, it's also a psychological trauma for them and their families. The BBC has approached both the Maltese government and the hospital's administration for comment.

Half Russian separatist force dead or wounded - UK - BBC News,"By Paul Kirby BBC News Russian and Russian proxy forces in the Donetsk region of Ukraine have suffered heavy casualties, according to UK intelligence officials. Russian forces are focused on conquering all of neighbouring Luhansk, aiming to encircle the city of Lysychansk, say Ukrainian leaders. UK military intelligence said Russia was very likely aiming to deploy a large number of reserve units to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, which is made up of Donetsk and Luhansk. that 2,128 of its forces had been killed and 8,897 wounded. A further 654 civilians had been killed, said Daria Morozova. In a separate development, Russian forces fired seven missiles at the southern city of Mykolaiv on Wednesday, according to local leader Vitaliy Kim, who did not give details of casualties. In its daily briefing, UK intelligence said the casualties suffered by Donetsk's proxy militia For months there have been reports of civilians being conscripted into the militia by force, with low morale and poor quality weapons, including rifles that went out of service decades ago.

Ukraine war: No easy exit from besieged Lysychansk - BBC News,"By Orla Guerin BBC News, Lysychansk If you had only 15 minutes to pack up and run for your life, what would you take? That was the dilemma confronting Katya when volunteers arrived at her home on the outskirts of Lysychansk. The war had landed on her doorstep a day earlier, when a Russian shell hit her garden and shrapnel pierced her metal front door. Katya flitted back and forth between piles of belongings in her home of nine years. In the end, she picked up only a plastic folder containing her family's key documents, including their passports. Artyom was pale and sombre, with blood seeping through a bandage on his knee.  He was injured by shelling when he went to get water. For the past two months, they have been risking their own lives to evacuate civilians from frontline areas. They have a ritual on the way to Lysychansk.  Before the riskiest stretch of the journey, they don their flak jackets and briefly stand in a circle to pray. We joined them on the journey into Lysychansk and were soon grateful for that prayer. As we drove into the city, a Russian shell exploded about 250m ahead of us. We felt the blast wave inside our armoured car.  Without their pause for prayer, we would have been further along the road driving into the path of the explosion. We saw soldiers digging trenches, in preparation for a possible ground assault.  A military source told us there are Russian forces just 2km from the city limits. They already control almost all of neighbouring Severdonetsk, after weeks of intense fighting there. Local officials estimate that between 7,000 to 8,000 people remain in Lysychansk despite the danger and the deprivation. Many are trapped by fear, according to Anton Yaremchuk. For now, he and his team keep banging on doors, offering a way out.  After a few attempts, they found the home of a man called Sacha, who had suffered a suspected stroke. For five days he had not had medical attention. For three days he had not eaten. As the light was fading, the team made their last call of the day, to collect a couple and their four daughters. The mother, Nina, came rushing with her toddler, Katia, in her arms. Two more young daughters were lifted into the van, one of whom has started stuttering since the war broke out. Their faces were streaked with dirt, Nina's with tears. Then her eldest, Lada, emerged from a doorway.  At 12, she is old enough to carry some bags and to grasp the changes around her. When asked if her friends had left, she stood still and burst into tears. It feels like Lysychansk is running out of time.

White House unveils plans to reduce nicotine in cigarettes - BBC News,"But the measure is likely to face opposition by the tobacco industry. Smoking remains the US's leading cause of death, accounting for 480,000 every year, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dr Calif added that lowering nicotine levels may decrease the likelihood that young people become addicted to cigarettes and help current smokers quit. But experts say it could take at least a year for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates cigarettes, to issue a proposed rule which could then be delayed by opposition, according to the Washington Post It added the tobacco industry, which is likely to be fiercely opposed to such a big change in products, could challenge a final regulation in court.

Uvalde shooting: Robb Elementary School to be demolished - mayor - BBC News,"Don McLaughlin made the claim on Tuesday at a tense and emotional council meeting with residents demanding answers over the shooting. He did not say when the school would be demolished. Public anger has risen since the May rampage, with police accused of waiting over an hour to confront the assailant. Robb Elementary has nearly 600 students in the second, third and fourth grades. US President Joe Biden had suggested knocking down the school, State Senator Roland Gutierrez told local media last month. Robb Elementary will not be the first school to be demolished after a mass shooting. Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, was razed after 20 students aged six and seven years old and six staff members were shot in 2012. A new school was built on the same land. Texas's public safety chief said on Tuesday there were enough police on the scene in Uvalde to have stopped the gunman three minutes after he entered the building. But police waited for more than an hour outside classrooms before a team made entry. US Senators on Tuesday advanced new legislation to address mass shootings in what has been called the most significant new gun controls in a generation.

Canada MPs given panic buttons as threats increase - BBC News,"By Tiffany Wertheimer BBC News Canada's members of parliament will be given panic buttons to call police in an emergency, amid growing harassment, intimidation and threats of violence. The move was announced by Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino who has himself received death threats. Canada's MPs have also been threatened on the streets and last year PM Justin Trudeau was pelted with rocks. Mr Mendicino, who said he was threatened last month after introducing a gun control bill in parliament, said the mobile alarms would add another layer of security for politicians. Several politicians have previously criticised the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which is in charge of their safety, for not taking their concerns seriously. One politician in particular has been targeted by abuse. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the small leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) and a practising Sikh, was harassed by angry protesters last month during a campaign visit in Peterborough, Ontario. Fellow NDP MP Heather McPherson told CBC news that she was worried about her family's safety, and has previously received threats to kill her pet dog. Freedom Convoy saw the city brought to a standstill as hundreds of lorries blocked roads. Canadian media reported that for a few days during the protest, Mr Trudeau and his family were evacuated to a secret location for their own safety. In 2020, a man armed with several guns drove a truck through the gates of the estate where Mr Trudeau and his family lived. The man, who had made social media posts about QAnon, said he wanted to talk to the prime minister, but was arrested without incident and later plead guilty. Last month the PM was forced to cancel plans to appear in person at a Liberal fundraiser in British Colombia after concerns that an aggressive protest outside the event could escalate.

Europe told to prepare for Russia turning off gas - BBC News,"By Jonah Fisher BBC Environment Correspondent The head of the International Energy Agency has warned that Russia may stop supplying gas to Europe this winter. Fatih Birol says he believes a complete shutdown is not the most likely scenario but that Europe needs to work on contingency plans just in case. In recent weeks several European countries said they received significantly less Russian gas than they expected. Russian officials deny it's deliberate and have blamed technical issues. Across Europe, shortfalls in gas supply continue to be reported. On Friday the Italian firm energy firm Eni said that it had only received half of the gas that it was expecting France says it has received no Russian gas from Germany since 15 June while Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands have had their Russian gas deliveries suspended after they refused a demand to pay in Russian roubles.

The tiny mites that have sex on our faces have a problem - BBC News,"By Sam Harris Newsbeat reporter Exfoliate, moisturise and SPF every day are the standard in most people's skincare routine. But what about pore cleaning mites like Demodex folliculorum that spend their entire life living deep in our faces? At night, the 0.3mm long organisms leave the pores to find a new skin follicle, meet a partner and mate. But a new study has found the mites could be facing a problem as their DNA is eroding, meaning they are close to extinction. Now we know what you're thinking. The study shows just how close our relationship is with them, but also how the mites have the smallest number of genes in any insect, arachnid or crustacean. The gene which protects the mite's body from UV light has been lost but in all fairness they are only active at night. Yes, these creatures are using our pores like the Love Island hideaway. Nice. For example, the research expected to find the gene which wakes up the mites and sends them to sleep but it wasn't present. Instead, the organism detects the lower amount of hormones secreted in the skin whilst we're asleep and it's this which triggers them to wake up. These adaptations are causing the issue. The more they adapt to us, the more genes they lose and eventually they will become entirely dependent on us for their existence. Because of this dependence they won't be able to leave our pores and find a new mate to couple up with. Well and truly putting all their eggs in one basket. So what's the issue if we do lose them?

"Ukraine: Could it join the EU, and how might Russia react? - BBC News","EU leaders are expected to back the move at a summit being held on 23 and 24 June. And the Ukrainian president has warned Russia may increase its military attacks in retaliation to the decision. The European Union is an economic and political union between 27 European countries, which was created in the aftermath of the Second World War. Goods, services and money move freely between member states. EU citizens can live and work anywhere within the bloc. It operates a single European currency, the euro, which is used by more than 340 million people in 19 of the EU's 27 countries. Common standards apply across member states in a number of areas including food safety, farming and employment rights. The EU also gives grants to Europe's poorer regions to help strengthen their economies. President Volodymyr Zelensky began the application for EU membership five days after Russia invaded his country in February 2022. He asked to be able to join immediately, but the process could take years. There would be financial benefits to joining the EU. But Ukraine's main motive is not economic, argues Dr Zach Paikin, from the Centre of European Policy Studies think tank in Brussels. Firstly, the European Commission, the EU's civil service, assesses whether a country is a suitable candidate It considers whether it has a stable, democratic government, respects human rights, and has a free market economy. All existing EU members have to agree before a new country can become a candidate. If successful, the country has to adopt all the EU's laws and regulations. This normally takes several years. Finally, the country signs an accession treaty which all the other EU countries have to ratify. For recent joiners Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, the entire process took between 10 and 12 years. Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia have been official candidates for years, but their applications have stalled. Turkey became a candidate in 1999.

How Russia has outflanked Ukraine in Africa - BBC News,"By Paul Melly Africa Programme, Chatham House, London Addresses to summits and national parliaments around the world by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have become a staple of the diplomatic calendar over the last few months. But when he spoke to the African Union (AU) on Monday only four heads of state from the continent listened in, with the others represented by subordinates or officials. So, in trying to shift African perspectives on Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, Mr Zelensky cannot deploy political or security clout comparable with Moscow's. Ukraine is not a global military power and it is not a permanent member of the UN Security Council, unlike Russia. As a result, many African leaders have concluded that they simply cannot afford to emulate direct Western confrontation with Moscow. Early this month Senegal's President Macky Sall, the current head of the AU, flew to the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi to discuss with Mr Putin how to free up the obstacles that are curbing desperately needed food exports from both Russia and Ukraine. And last week South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa called Mr Putin to discuss deliveries of Russian agricultural products and fertiliser to Africa. The talks produced some modest progress though not a decisive breakthrough. Meanwhile, there are some hints that the invasion of Ukraine may be putting strains on Russian military engagement in Africa, with unconfirmed rumours of some troops from the mercenary group Wagner being called back from Central African Republic (CAR). That would hardly be a surprise, given the demands of the intense military campaign in the crucial Donbas region. Moreover, official Russian security and military deals in Africa are actually being reinforced. Cameroon has become the latest target of this charm offensive. This embraces intelligence, training and sharing expertise in tackling terrorism and maritime piracy. Joint exercises are planned. The document makes no mention of arms shipments but hints suggestively that additional forms of collaboration could yet be agreed. Although this new agreement is less specific, it appears to be stirring concern in Western capitals. However, some African governments are reluctant to buy into this negative perception of the Putin regime. And that applies not only to those such as Mali and CAR. Senegal, for example, opted not to support the 2 March UN General Assembly motion calling on Russia to stop using force against Ukraine. And then on 7 April the country also abstained when the General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. Domestic public opinion plays a part in such stances. Lining up with France, the US and the UK is not always the most popular stance on the continent and the Cameroonian government, like a number of its peers, appears to have concluded that it had to take account of such popular feelings. However, Cameroon is going much further, taking the proactive decision to sign the new military cooperation agreement with Russia even as Russian forces continued to bombard Ukrainian cities. This distinctive stance is probably explained by the domestic situation in Cameroon. Yet Western partners are concerned about human rights and governance issues and their assistance has come with conditions. With the Americans holding back, some Cameroonian analysts fear that the government may now have decided to seek alternative support from a partner with fewer scruples about uncompromising military tactics, at the cost of human rights accountability. Moscow's track record elsewhere in Africa suggests that it is comfortable in backing a hardline approach. In CAR, Wagner has been training the army since 2018 and its men helped government forces repulse a rebel assault on the capital Bangui in early 2021. Wagner also operates alongside the national army in central Mali where, Human Rights Watch and local people have alleged, these two allied forces have tortured and killed villagers. Malian government forces and the Russian mercenaries are alleged to have killed more than 300 people in Moura  in March.

Kaliningrad: Russia warns Lithuania of consequences over rail transit blockade - BBC News,"Lithuania says it is only following the EU sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The western territory was annexed from Germany after World War Two in 1945 and is bordered by EU and Nato members Lithuania and Poland. Earlier on Tuesday, the EU ambassador was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry over the blockade. Last week, the Lithuanian authorities announced they would ban goods subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to Kaliningrad. The EU has echoed Lithuania's statement, saying that the country is just implementing sanctions imposed by the EU as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology. As a member of the Nato military alliance, Lithuania is protected by collective defence treaties.

The family separated by war in both life and death - BBC News,"By Wyre Davies in Vinnytsia, Ukraine I first met Vladimir at Zaporizhzhia's children's hospital three months ago Diana has, miraculously, pulled through, although she's got a long way to go, and may never fully recover from the attack which left shrapnel in her brain and damaged much of the right side of her body. Thanks to informal networks of doctors and medical charities, many victims of the war, including children from the hospital in Zaporizhzhia, were subsequently evacuated to Germany for the complicated surgery they couldn't get in Ukraine. When we first met her, three months ago, Masha was fighting for her life in the same Zaporizhzhia hospital as Diana. Masha's right leg had been blown off by a Russian shell, and she had other extensive injuries. She was so traumatised she wouldn't eat or speak for days. Despite everything, Masha appears to be doing well and when she occasionally breaks into a smile, it's enough to melt the toughest of hearts. Masha is fortunate enough to have the people she needs around her. The rest of her family are nearby, recovering from less serious injuries they received in the same rocket attack. Diana was a talented dancer before the war and travelled all over Europe competing. But, as the only surviving child in her family, the one thing Diana wants more than anything is to have her beloved dad, Vladimir, by her side. They speak every day by video call and the bond between father and daughter is clear. Modern technology has made separation slightly less painful, but with Diana still in a bad way, this bereaved family needs to be together. Until now Ukraine's martial laws have prevented Vladimir travelling abroad to be with his wife and surviving daughter. On Sunday night, at the eleventh hour, his prayers were quite literally answered as he received presidential permission to leave. His daughter is still seriously ill but at least her father, Vladimir, will now be by her side.

Hundreds of thousands evacuated as floods ravage southern China - BBC News,"By Zubaidah Abdul Jalil BBC News Hundreds of thousands of people in China have been evacuated in several southern and eastern provinces after unrelenting rains caused floods and triggered landslides. Videos on state media show cars being washed down streets, and people being rescued by ropes across swollen rivers. The area is seeing its highest rainfall since 1961, weather officials say. The city of Shaoguan in Guangdong province has been one of the worst affected, prompting officials to raise its flood alert to the highest level as the city charted record rainfall since late May. A similar alert was put in place for Guangdong's Qingyuan city. Local officials have warned the situation is likely to worsen over the coming days and will continue to raise water levels in the Pearl River basin. The summer rainy season regularly results in flooding in southern China, but there are concerns that climate change is exacerbating the situation. In contrast, many areas in the north of the country are experiencing unusually high temperatures, but the rain is forecast to hit there next.

Supreme Court: What happens if Roe v Wade overturned? - BBC News,"BBC News The US Supreme Court could be about to open the door for individual states to ban or severely restrict the ability for pregnant women to get abortions. In 1973, the court had ruled in Roe v Wade that pregnant people were entitled to an abortion during the first three months of their pregnancy, while allowing for legal restrictions and bans in the second and third trimester. But a leaked draft of their forthcoming ruling suggests the court is poised to overturn that earlier ruling, effectively making it possible for states to ban abortions earlier than 12 weeks. The decision is expected sometime later this month. Guttmacher Institute , a research organisation that supports abortion rights. About 630,000 abortions were performed in the US in 2019, according to the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), although Guttmacher's own research indicates it may be closer to 860,000. Over the past decade, several states have also tried to pass laws making abortion illegal, except in a few circumstances such as if the pregnant woman's life is at risk. Some of those laws were struck down by lower courts, as they appeared to violate Roe v Wade. If Roe v Wade is overturned, they will likely come back into force. In total more than 20 states are making moves to limit access to abortion, according to Guttmacher. Some states intend to ban abortion from the moment of conception, while others are introducing bans at six or more weeks. All states allow abortion to save the life of the mother, while some will also allow exceptions to their ban for cases of rape or incest. Most have said they will not prosecute women for trying to end their pregnancy, reserving criminal penalties for abortion providers and others who try and help people get abortions. Here's a look at what could happen in those states if Roe v Wade is overturned. A trigger law passed in 2022 would go into effect, banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy. A trigger law passed in 2006 would go into effect, banning abortion at any stage. A trigger law that passed in 2021 would go into effect, banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. There is an exception to protect the life of the mother. Providing an abortion otherwise would be punishable with prison time. In May, Oklahoma passed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, banning abortion from the moment of fertilisation. That provision essentially bypassed Roe v Wade entirely, putting it up to private citizens, not the state, to enforce the law. A bill banning abortion after six weeks, which was passed in 2019 but blocked by a judge, could go into effect if Roe falls. The bill would make exceptions only to protect the life of the mother. Doctors who perform an abortion could face up to 25 years in prison and lose their medical licence. A trigger law passed in 2019 could go into effect, banning abortion at any stage. A trigger law passed in 2007 would go into effect, banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy. A trigger law passed in 2019 would go into effect, making abortions illegal at any stage of pregnancy. A trigger law passed in 2007 would go into effect, banning abortion at any stage. There are exceptions for saving the life of the mother, rape or incest. Violators could face fines and imprisonment and it would make abortions a felony. A trigger law passed in 2005 would go into effect, banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy. A trigger law passed in 2019 would ban abortion at any stage of pregnancy. A 1849 law banning most abortions could come into effect again. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. There is an exception for saving the life of the mother. A trigger law passed in 2022 goes into effect, banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy. There are exceptions for life endangerment, severe physical health conditions, sexual assault and incest.  Anyone who performs an abortion could be charged with a felony. There are exceptions for medical emergencies, cases of rape or incest that have been documented through an official police report and are fewer than 20 weeks along. In 2018, Iowa passed a bill banning abortion after six weeks, except in cases of rape, incest, foetal anomaly, or in a medical emergency risking death or serious injury. In March, Arizona passed a law banning abortion at 15 weeks, except in cases of medical emergency. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. It could go into force at the end of September. A doctor found to have performed an illegal abortion after 15 weeks would face a felony charge, fines and up to five years in prison. They could also have their medical licence revoked. A 1973 law banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy is still on the books. In 2015 it was amended to narrow the exceptions, allowing abortions only in cases where the life of the mother was threatened, or she risked serious physical bodily harm. Doctors who perform abortions could be charged with a felony. But a court ruled that law was unenforceable because of Roe v Wade. It could come back into force. The state could look to restore a 19th century law which criminalises abortion as a felony. In a 2018 ballot, voters amended the state's constitution to say there are no protections in West Virgina for the right to abortion. The map showing states expected to be among the first to restrict abortion includes only those in which laws will either automatically come into force or which require no more than a signature from the state governor or attorney general certifying that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v Wade. States with abortion laws which have been blocked by the courts and therefore require legal action to appeal or dismiss them are not shown, these include Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and West Virginia. The Guttmacher Institute's 2014 Abortion Patient Survey still provides the most recent national overview on the social and economic background of those having abortions in the US. However, changes in the US economy and access to abortion over the last eight years means the picture could have changed.

Monkeypox: First Singapore case recorded in British flight attendant - BBC News,"By Frances Mao BBC News Singapore has recorded its first recent case of monkeypox in a British flight attendant who entered the country last week. More than 2,100 cases have been detected in 42 countries since May. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , but the disease has also spread to North America, South America and Australia. The WHO has recorded one death in this outbreak. The disease typically occurs in remote parts of central and west African countries, but there have been unusually high numbers of people infected with monkeypox outside of Africa this year with no travel links to the region. Watch What Is Monkeypox? on BBC iPlayer. In Singapore, health officials said the man was in a stable condition after testing positive for the disease on Monday and had been taken into an isolation ward. Thirteen of his close contacts have also been put in quarantine. They were his crew and airline colleagues, some media outlets reported. South Korean authorities on Tuesday also confirmed their first suspected cases of the disease. Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe. Symptoms of monkeypox include a rash which starts on the face and spreads to the body. The WHO says the risk to the general public remains low as transmission between humans requires close or direct physical contact with infectious lesions or ulcers.

US Supreme Court: The woman who could end Roe v Wade - BBC News,"By Holly Honderich BBC News, Washington The attorney general was there to celebrate. The United States Supreme Court had just announced the date it would hear her state's challenge to Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that has, for the nearly 50 years since, served as a nationwide guarantee to abortion access. The case, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, centres on a Mississippi law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, even in cases of rape or incest. Under Ms Fitch's direction, the state asked the Supreme Court to uphold the law and slash the landmark Roe v Wade decision in the process. A ruling is expected this month. A leaked draft suggests it is likely that Mississippi's ban will be upheld, paving the way for other states to also outlaw abortion. Abortion was not always an animating theme of Ms Fitch's political career. When she first took public office, as Mississippi state treasurer in 2011, she pushed for legislation that would guarantee men and women were paid equally. It wasn't for another couple of years that she did, launching a campaign for state treasurer. Mr Dent, who had kept tabs on Ms Fitch, reached out to her in the middle of that 2011 cycle and asked to come on board her campaign. She accepted. The two would drive the length of the state in a day, making a handful of different stops and placing fundraiser calls in the hours between. She was a natural campaigner, but fundraising lagged. Mr Dent drove to northern Mississippi to ask her father for a personal donation. Bill Fitch still lived in Holly Springs, the small, rural town near the state's northern edge where Ms Fitch spent most of her childhood. Visitors of Fitch Farms could elect to stay in the former home of Confederate general and first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, Nathan Bedford Forrest, which Mr Fitch had bought and transported onto the property. She went to the University of Mississippi, joined a sorority and graduated with a degree in business administration and later in law. She won, and then won again four years later, securing a second term as state treasurer. In this office, she targeted state debt, expanded access to financial education in the state, and advocated for equal pay laws (Mississippi remains the only state that does not ensure equal pay for equal work between men and women). And she developed her knack for connecting to voters, leaning on both her Holly Springs upbringing and an apparent ease in the public eye. In interviews and campaign videos, Ms Fitch looks preternaturally poised. She makes easy eye contact, her speech slow and relaxed, often thanking God and her family for the opportunity to serve her state. As a devoted Republican in a solidly Republican state, where Ms Fitch stood on abortion was taken as given, even if she didn't run on it. The abortion ban before the Supreme Court was passed by Mississippi's state legislature in 2018, two years before Ms Fitch took office as Attorney General. The law, which bans abortions outright after 15 weeks, was immediately challenged in court on behalf of Jackson Women's Health Organization, Mississippi's last remaining abortion clinic. A federal district court struck down the ban, saying it was unconstitutional. In 2019, an appeals court upheld this decision. Now, she's known nationally as the lawyer expected to topple Roe v Wade. Mississippi, specifically, has no state laws mandating paid family leave. It is the poorest state in the nation and has the highest rates of both infant mortality and child poverty. But if Roe is indeed thrown out, Ms Fitch will return to Mississippi a conservative hero. There are also early rumblings that she may one day run for governor. She has not yet commented on this speculation. If she wins, Ms Fitch would be the first female governor in Mississippi's history.

Olena's husband Pavlo also made his wife leave their home in the capital Kyiv for the safety of her and their two children.

French elections: What now for opposition left and far-right? - BBC News,"By Paul Kirby In Paris They were the big winners of France's elections, tearing apart President Emmanuel Macron's majority. They are poles apart but have largely the same ambition of opposing the centrist Macron government. The surprise of the elections was the success of Marine Le Pen's far right National Rally, which increased its presence in the Assembly tenfold. A look at the dark blue areas on the map shows how far they have spread from their strongholds in the deep south and Pas de Calais in the north. Their success in 89 seats came even though Ms Le Pen was barely visible on the campaign trail in the two weeks before the vote. Both parties aim to resist the president's programme of reforms, although National Rally has said it may back measures to alleviate the cost of living crisis if their own proposals are adopted. Where the two parties are united is in opposition to the president's bid to raise gradually the retirement age from 62 to 65.

The Punjabi rapper, who is credited with popularising rap in rural areas, was shot dead on 29 May when his car was ambushed by unidentified gunmen. His death sparked deep anger and outrage as fans from across the world mourned the loss of the eclectic pop star. So far, over a dozen people have been arrested during the investigation, which is being jointly carried out by the police in Delhi and Punjab state, where Moose Wala lived and died. Born as Subhdeep Singh Sidhu in Moosa village in Mansa district, the singer started his musical journey in Canada in 2016. Since then, he had released three albums and more than 60 singles and become a household name in Punjab and among the diaspora Sikh population in the UK and Canada. Fans loved how his songs offered unvarnished commentary on the dark underbelly of the rural heartland, where drugs, crime and corruption often make headlines. Through his lyrics and delivery, which incorporated the styles of the region's folk music, the singer inspired a generation of young Punjabis living in India and abroad to proudly accept their roots. But Moose Wala was also a highly controversial figure. The edgy singer had an affinity for guns, which he would brandish in his music videos and on his social media profiles. He also had police cases against him for allegedly promoting gun violence in Punjab. Underlying issues like corruption and rising unemployment have strengthened their reign over the state's cities and villages. Lawrence Bishnoi, who has denied the allegations against him, is in jail in India. Police say they are trying to extradite Goldy Brar who has made no statements in connection with the Moose Wala case. On Monday, police said they had evidence that one of the shooters had been in direct contact with him at the time of the murder. In a press release, police said, one of the accused had kept tabs on the singer's movements by pretending to be a fan. For one, the singer was hugely popular and deeply revered by his fans, who have been angered by his murder. But the big lead came when the police recovered a fuel receipt dated 25 May, just days before the murder. The receipt was found in the car allegedly used for the crime, which was abandoned 13km (eight miles) from the spot where Moose Wala was shot. A police team immediately went to the petrol pump which had issued the receipt, combed through its CCTV footage and managed to identify one of the shooters. The footage also revealed the route the accused took to reach Moose Wala, according to police. By tracing the car owner, the police also managed to recover all the vehicles used in the crime, they said.

Thailand cannabis: From a war on drugs to weed curries - BBC News,"Other countries in the region have followed the same punitive approach, notably the Philippines after President Rodrigo Duterte took office in 2016. Singapore and Malaysia have imposed the death penalty for drug trafficking for decades. Tourists coming to South East Asia have long been warned of the harsh penalties they face if caught with even small amounts of marijuana. It's hard to imagine, then, that what we have seen over the past weeks is actually happening in Thailand. architect of the new law, which now gives Thailand perhaps the most liberal marijuana regime anywhere in the world The new law appears to give Thailand what is perhaps the most liberal approach to marijuana anywhere in the world. For the moment, people can grow and consume as much of the plant as they like, though there are a few limits on how they can market and sell it. Two grandparents, his father and then his mother died from cancer. On rushing back from the US to care for his mother, he tried, and failed, to persuade her to use cannabis products to ease her pain, and found it difficult to get access to what were then illegal substances. What explains this dramatic turnaround in a country still led by conservative military men who seem unlikely drug law liberalisers? So, he was able to tell the cheering crowds, as he announced the new law in his political home base of Buriram earlier this month, that he had delivered what he had promised. He believes in the medical benefits of legalisation, which he hopes will allow poorer Thais to grow their own treatments, rather than having to pay for expensive chemical drugs. He has opened the first clinic in Bangkok that focuses solely on these kinds of treatments. Already some of Thailand's biggest corporations are looking at ways in which they can cash in on the weed bonanza. By liberalising the law so quickly and so completely, the government hopes to steal a march on neighbouring countries, many of which may in any case be reluctant to follow the trail blazed by Thailand. It was a military minister of justice, General Paiboon Kumchaya, who announced in 2016 that the war on drugs had failed, and another, less punitive method of dealing with the use and abuse of narcotics was needed. However, the government may not have been prepared for the enthusiastic embrace of cannabis in all its forms seen across Thailand since the new law was passed. The government is now drafting additional regulations over its use. Officially its position is that the law only allows cannabis use for medical, not recreational purposes, but it's hard to see how they will enforce that distinction. She is experimenting with different strains of the plant to help local farmers cultivate the right kinds for the region. Mr Kruesopon says he has no issue with further regulation. He advocates sales of marijuana only from licensed vendors, with a prescription, and never to anyone under 18 years old. This is an uncharacteristically bold step by the Thai government, into a brave new world. The rest of the region will be watching to see if it pays off.

"Ankur Warikoo, Rachana Ranade: The YouTubers Indians turn to for financial advice - BBC News","By Nikhil Inamdar and  Ayushi Shah BBC News He rummaged through books and tutorials, but quickly learnt that it was the young financial content creators on YouTube that spoke his language. It's exactly what India's young investors are after. Millions of them opened trading accounts during the pandemic to participate in the market bull run, aided by investing services online. But only three out of 10 Indians are financially literate, official surveys point out. And they are hungry to learn how to make an easy buck in the stock market, or the ropes of entrepreneurship amid a unicorn boom that's made overnight billionaires. It's this sweet spot that's turned financial content into one of the fastest growing genres online. His massive popularity even got him a publishing contract last year, with his first book, Do Epic Shit, quickly becoming a bestseller. While the perception is that he became a sensation overnight, Mr Warikoo says his journey as a content creator started nearly a decade ago. But the pandemic proved to be an inflection point. That's a gap in the market that many of the YouTubers have successfully been able to fill. Experts laud the fact that financial education is now more accessible, but they also advise caution. While business news channels are strictly regulated, most digital content creators operate in a grey zone. Ms Ranade and Mr Warikoo do not recommend individual stocks, but many others do, often without the necessary expertise or qualifications. So the next few years, Mr Ethiraj says, will be the first test of whether the success of India's new money influencers is enduring or merely ephemeral.

Jason Ravnsborg: South Dakota prosecutor ousted over hit-and-run - BBC News,"South Dakota lawmakers have voted to impeach and remove from office the state's attorney general over a 2020 car crash in which he killed a man. Jason Ravnsborg has said he thought he struck a deer while driving home at night on 12 September 2020 and did not know it was a man until the next day. The Republican had refused to resign over the incident. Despite facing opposition from all corners, Ravnsborg maintained his innocence in the death of Joseph Boever, 55. Last year, he beat the criminal case against him by taking a plea deal on misdemeanour traffic charges. But his luck ran out in the state legislature, where he was impeached by the House in April. On Tuesday, the Senate convicted Ravnsborg for committing crimes that caused someone's death, and on a malfeasance charge for misleading law enforcement and abusing the powers of his office. The move triggers his automatic removal from office. The chamber also voted unanimously to bar the prosecutor from holding future office in the state. Investigators arriving at the scene one day after the crash found a working torch, which was still on and only inches from the road, and bone scrapings on the ground. Ravnsborg is the first official to be impeached in state history.

England in Netherlands: Jason Roy's century leads England to victory in third ODI - BBC Sport,"Last updated on 1 hour ago 1 hour ago From the section Cricket comments Buttler deputised for injured captain Eoin Morgan, who was suffering with a groin injury, and saw the Dutch dismissed for 244 as Scott Edwards (64) top scored. This was the ninth time Buttler has skippered England in ODIs and his record reads won six, lost three. Morgan's enforced absence meant he was denied the chance to atone for two consecutive ducks in the first and second matches in Amstelveen because of injury. It will inevitably raise question marks about whether, at 35 and with his form and fitness seemingly deserting him, he will continue as England captain. His future in the side may be in doubt but the team Morgan built in his image continued their buccaneering approach to comfortably dispose of a Dutch side ranked 14th in the world. Buttler's innings was not quite as breathtaking as his incredible 162 off 70 balls in the first ODI, but it was chanceless as he and Roy took England home relatively serenely. The win gave England 10 points in the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League and saw them leapfrog Bangladesh into top spot in the competition, which determines qualification for the tournament in India in 16 months' time. On a pitch with a touch more grass than the first two ODIs there was bounce and carry for England's attack and the softly spoken Buttler calmly and efficiently directed proceedings from behind the stumps as he got his bowling changes spot on. England made a blistering start to the chase as Phil Salt (49) and Roy stamped their authority on the Dutch attack with a stand of 85 for the first wicket. In stark contrast to regular skipper Morgan, who has had looked so dreadfully out of touch here, Buttler oozed form, finesse and firepower with the bat. Roy regrouped and, with Buttler fast catching him, brought up his 10th ODI century off 86 balls with a confident drive down the ground. It was England's 34th six of the series as they sealed the win with 19.5 overs to spare. In this kind of form they will take some stopping in the rest of the summer, with or without Morgan.

The Open: Players who have joined LIV Golf series permitted to play at St Andrews - BBC Sport,"Last updated on 6 hours ago 6 hours ago From the section The PGA Tour suspended 17 members who played in the inaugural LIV Golf event, including Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson. Exempt players are those who are eligible through their previously earned status, such as world rankings and tournament victories. The PGA does not run the majors and so LIV golfers who would be allowed to play at the Open include Johnson, Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, Patrick Reed and Abaham Ancer, plus Brooks Koepka who is set to join the rebel series LIV Golf players were also permitted to compete at last week's US Open, which was won by England's Matt Fitzpatrick. Like Fitzpatrick, defending Open champion Collin Morikawa has not joined LIV Golf, taking to social media on Tuesday to deny rumours he was planning to join the series. Iain Carter, BBC golf correspondent It is possible they could alter qualifying criteria for future events. World rankings also play a key role in deciding eligibility for all majors. For rebel players hoping to compete in championships beyond this year, much might depend on whether LIV Golf's application for official ranking status is successful.

Sadio Mane: Bayern Munich sign Senegal forward from Liverpool in £35m deal - BBC Sport,"Last updated on 1 hour ago 1 hour ago From the section Liverpool comments Liverpool turned down two bids from Bayern before agreeing a fee for the Senegal forward, who was under contract until next summer. Mane joined Liverpool for and scored 120 goals in 269 games, finishing last season with 23 goals in all competitions. Mane helped Liverpool win the Champions League and the Premier League, and in February scored the winning penalty as Senegal won the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time. Last week Liverpool confirmed the signing of Uruguay forward Darwin Nunez In a farewell interview for the Liverpool website, With Jurgen Klopp having been appointed Liverpool manager in October 2015, Mane was the German's first major signing at Anfield the following summer. Roberto Firmino was already at the club and Mohammed Salah arrived in 2017 to complete what would become one of the greatest forward lines in Premier League history. In five seasons in all competitions, they scored 338 goals between them, helping Liverpool become champions of Europe for the sixth time in 2019 and then win the English league title for the first time in 30 years. With the trio moving into or near to their 30s, Liverpool prepared for the evolution of their attacking ranks by signing Diogo Jota and then Luis Diaz, but Mane's departure could be seen as the end of an era at Anfield. Klopp told the Liverpool website. Will the summer signings of Nunez and teenager Fabio Carvalho from Fulham, allied with the arrivals of Jota and Diaz, spark a second phase of success for Klopp on Merseyside?

Raheem Sterling: Man City forward faces career-defining decision amid Chelsea interest - BBC Sport,"Last updated on 9 hours ago 9 hours ago From the section Premier League comments Raheem Sterling has some big decisions to make. A month after coming off the bench to be a key figure in Manchester City's stunning comeback win over Aston Villa Sources close to the player say Sterling, who has a year left on his contract, has had no substantive talks with anyone about his future and is yet to make up his mind which way to go. It is not a decision to take lightly. Sterling is about to enter the peak years of his career and wants to get the most out of them. There is also a World Cup in November to consider for the man who was widely considered to be the star performer in England's run to the European Championship final last summer. Sterling recognises his manager, who arrived at the club in the summer after the England forward joined, has taught him a lot. His technical understanding of the game has improved beyond all recognition. With 109 goals and 56 assists in 320 Premier League appearances, Sterling has confirmed his status as one of the most effective domestic performers. By any definition, Sterling's time at City has been a success. And this is where the dilemma lies. But Erling Haaland's summer arrival from Borussia Dortmund appears to change the dynamic at City. But the England forward cannot feel confident of his place. And, one way or another, within the next 12 months he will commit to the deal that will probably define his career. Real Madrid and Chelsea are the clubs mentioned most often around Sterling. Would Sterling fit the bill? That is a matter of debate but he would fit into a team where Karim Benzema is turning in performances at a level that defies his veteran status. Chelsea are likely to have a vacancy in attack given Romelu Lukaku's almost certain exit. On the face of it, though, both clubs offer the chance to compete for the biggest prizes. The alternative is to remain where he is, which raises one of two options. The first is to try to negotiate a new deal with City. Sterling is already very well paid due to the contract he signed in 2018 and the club's willingness to engage will be an indication of how much Guardiola wants him around. One thing is for certain, whatever path he chooses, it will be big news.
