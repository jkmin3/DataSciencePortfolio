Nigeria will also not accept medical and dental programmes offered online. Some of those students who spoke to the BBC say it is a huge blow to their studies and careers, especially for those who had spent more than five years studying and only have a few months left until graduation. They call the policy discriminatory, arguing that students who studied online during the pandemic were allowed to graduate and practise. Student have also criticised the government for failing to keep Nigerian universities open amid recent rolling strikes by lecturers, forcing them to study elsewhere.

"Afghan earthquake: At least 1,000 people killed and 1,500 injured - BBC News","BBC News This video can not be played A powerful earthquake has killed at least 1,000 people and injured 1,500 in eastern Afghanistan, an official of the ruling Taliban told the BBC. Hundreds of houses were destroyed by the magnitude 6.1 event, which occurred at a depth of 51km (32 miles). The earthquake struck about 44km from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Witnesses reported feeling the quake in both Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Earthquakes tend to cause significant damage in Afghanistan, where dwellings in many rural areas are unstable or poorly built. In remote areas, helicopters have been ferrying victims to hospitals. Speaking to the BBC, a doctor in Paktika said medical workers were among the victims. Communication following the quake is difficult because of damage to mobile phone towers and the death toll could rise further still, another local journalist in the area told the BBC. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage in Pakistan, according to BBC Urdu. Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it's located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Most recently, in January killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.

Afghanistan earthquake: 'Every street you go you hear mourning' - BBC News,"By Thom Poole BBC News This is how one Afghan described the situation after a powerful earthquake left hundreds dead. The quake happened in the early hours of the morning, causing houses to collapse and crush people sleeping inside. Rescuers have in some cases been digging with their bare hands, if they have been able to reach the affected areas at all. Rural eastern Afghanistan is not an easy place to travel to. The toll is expected to grow as the picture becomes clearer. Afghans are already facing hardship on several fronts. Poverty is rampant, and the country has endured decades of conflict. When the Taliban took over Afghanistan last year, many countries cut development aid. Already thinly stretched services are unlikely to be able to cope. This video can not be played Aid agencies are trying to help but communications and water provisions are adding to the challenge. They are focussing on bringing food, medicine and emergency shelter to those in need.
